Explorer:

Description:

You are tasked with building an Explorer component using React. The Explorer should mimic the functionality of file explorers like those found in VS Code or Windows Explorer. The Explorer component should consist of a tree structure with folders and files.

Your task is to implement a React component that represents the Explorer and allows users to navigate through folders and view files. Additionally, you should style the Explorer to make it visually appealing.

Requirements:

1. Use React to create a component called Explorer.
2. The Explorer component should display a tree structure with folders and files.
3. Users should be able to expand and collapse folders to view their contents.
4. Clicking on a file should open it or trigger an action (such as displaying its contents).
5. Ensure that the Explorer supports nested folders (folders within folders).
6. Style the Explorer to make it visually appealing. You can use CSS or any other styling method of your choice.
7. Provide basic functionality like creating, renaming, deleting folders and files (optional, but encouraged for enhanced user experience).
8. Ensure smooth navigation and interaction within the Explorer component.

Example:

Here's how the Explorer component should behave:
- Initially, the Explorer displays a root folder with its contents.
- Users can expand or collapse folders by clicking on them.
- Clicking on a file opens it or performs an action associated with it.
- Users can perform basic file management actions like creating, renaming, or deleting folders and files (optional, but encouraged).
- The Explorer provides a visually appealing and intuitive user interface for navigating through folders and viewing files.
